# Important
THESE THEMES ARE SUBJECT TO BREAK AND ARE NOT UPDATED AUTOMATICALLY, IF YOU WISH TO GET LATEST VERSION OF A THEME, CONTACT THE ORIGINAL OWNERS
With older themes, there are common issues like the arraylist not working. If this happens, a theme is outdated.         
I take no personal responsibility if there is malware in these files, I will try my best to proof check these, but there will always be vulnerabilities. 

## Installation

To install a theme from this repository, follow these steps:
1. Download the theme you want from this repository.
2. In a world, write in the chat ".client theme browse" - you should see a folder open.
3. Put the files needed into that folder
4. Write ".client theme set <theme>", replacing <theme> with your theme's name. If you entered the correct name, it should load the theme.

> This installation tutorial is not exhaustive, extra steps might need to be taken. If that is so, there should be a tutorial for your theme.
